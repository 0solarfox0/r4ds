# Introduction {#data-types-intro}

In this part of the book, you'll learn about data types, ...

<!--# TO DO: Add a diagram? -->

This part of the book proceeds as follows:

-   In Chapter \@ref(tibbles), you'll learn about the variant of the data frame that we use in this book: the **tibble**. You'll learn what makes them different from regular data frames, and how you can construct them "by hand".

Data wrangling also encompasses data transformation, which you've already learned a little about.
Now we'll focus on new skills for specific types of data you will frequently encounter in practice:

-   Chapter \@ref(relational-data) will give you tools for working with multiple interrelated datasets.

<!--# TO DO: Something about logicals and numbers -->

<!--# TO DO: Something about general vector tools -->

<!--# TO DO: Something about missing values -->

-   Chapter \@ref(strings) will give you tools for working with strings and introduce regular expressions, a powerful tool for manipulating strings.

-   Chapter \@ref(factors) will introduce factors -- how R stores categorical data.
    They are used when a variable has a fixed set of possible values, or when you want to use a non-alphabetical ordering of a string.

-   Chapter \@ref(dates-and-times) will give you the key tools for working with dates and date-times.
