# Strings

## Introduction

This chapter introduces you to strings in R.
You'll learn the basics of how strings work and how to create them by hand.
Big topic so spread over three chapters: here we'll focus on the basic mechanics, in Chapter \@ref(regular-expressions) we'll dive into the details of regular expressions the sometimes cryptic language for describing patterns in strings, and we'll return to strings later in Chapter \@ref(programming-with-strings) when we think about them about from a programming perspective (rather than a data analysis perspective).

While base R contains functions that allow us to perform pretty much all of the operations described in this chapter, here we're going to use the **stringr** package.
stringr has been carefully designed to be as consistent as possible so that knowledge gained about one function can be more easily transferred to the next.
stringr functions all start with the same `str_` prefix.
This is particularly useful if you use RStudio, because typing `str_` will trigger autocomplete, allowing you to see all stringr's functions:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/stringr-autocomplete.png")
```

### Prerequisites

This chapter will focus on the **stringr** package for string manipulation, which is part of the core tidyverse.
We'll also work with the babynames dataset.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
```

## Creating a string

To begin, let's discuss the mechanics of creating a string.
We've created strings in passing earlier in the book, but didn't discuss the details.
First, there are two basic ways to create a string: using either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
Unlike other languages, there is no difference in behaviour.
I recommend always using `"`, unless you want to create a string that contains multiple `"`.

```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'If I want to include a "quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'
```

If you forget to close a quote, you'll see `+`, the continuation character:

    > "This is a string without a closing quote
    + 
    + 
    + HELP I'M STUCK

If this happen to you, press Escape and try again.

### Escapes

To include a literal single or double quote in a string you can use `\` to "escape" it:

```{r}
double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"
```

Which means if you want to include a literal backslash, you'll need to double it up: `"\\"`:

```{r}
backslash <- "\\"
```

Beware that the printed representation of a string is not the same as string itself, because the printed representation shows the escapes.
To see the raw contents of the string, use `str_view()`:

```{r}
x <- c(single_quote, double_quote, backslash)
x
str_view(x)
```

### Raw strings

Creating a string with multiple quotes or backslashes gets confusing quickly.
For example, lets create a string that contains the contents of the chunk where I define the `double_quote` and `single_quote` variables:

```{r}
tricky <- "double_quote <- \"\\\"\" # or '\"'
single_quote <- '\\'' # or \"'\""
str_view(tricky)
```

You can instead use a **raw string**[^strings-1] to reduce the amount of escaping:

[^strings-1]: Available in R 4.0.0 and above.

```{r}
tricky <- r"(double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"
)"
str_view(tricky)
```

A raw string starts with `r"(` and finishes with `)"`.
If your string contains `)"` you can instead use `r"[]"` or `r"{}"`, and if that's still not enough, you can insert any number of dashes to make the opening and closing pairs unique, e.g. `` `r"--()--" ``, `` `r"---()---" ``,etc.

### Other special characters

As well as `\"`, `\'`, and `\\` there are a handful of other special characters that may come in handy. The most common are `"\n"`, newline, and `"\t"`, tab, but you can see the complete list in `?'"'`.

You'll also sometimes see strings containing Unicode escapes that start with `\u` or `\U`.
This is a way of writing non-English characters that works on all systems:

```{r}
x <- c("\u00b5", "\U0001f604")
x
str_view(x)
```

## Combining strings

Use `str_c()`[^strings-2] to join together multiple strings into a single string:

[^strings-2]: `str_c()` is very similar to the base `paste0()`.
    There are two main reasons I use it here: it obeys the usual rules for handling `NA`, and it uses the tidyverse recycling rules.

```{r}
str_c("x", "y")
str_c("x", "y", "z")
```

Like most other functions in R, missing values are contagious.
You can use `coalesce()` to replace missing values with a value of your choosing:

```{r}
x <- c("abc", NA)
str_c("|-", x, "-|")
str_c("|-", coalesce(x, ""), "-|")
```

Since `str_c()` creates a new variable, you'll usually use it with a `mutate()`:

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(greeting = str_c("Hi! I'm ", name, "."), .after = name)
```

Another powerful way of combining strings is with the glue package.
You can either use `glue::glue()` or call it via the `str_glue()` wrapper that string provides for you.
Glue works a little differently to the other methods: you give it a single string using `{}` to indicate where you want to interpolate in existing variables:

```{r}
str_glue("|-{x}-|")
```

Like `str_c()`, `str_glue()` pairs well with `mutate()`:

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(
    intro = str_glue("Hi! My is {name} and I'm a {species} from {homeworld}"),
    .keep = "none"
  )
```

You can use any valid R code inside of `{}`, but we recommend placing more complex calculations in their own variables.

## Length and subsetting

It's also natural to think about the letters that make up an individual string.
(But note that the idea of a "letter" isn't a natural fit to every language, we'll come back to that in Section \@ref(other-languages)).
For example, `str_length()` tells you the length, the number of characters:

```{r}
str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
```

You could use this with `count()` to find the distribution of lengths of US babynames:

```{r}
babynames %>%
  count(length = str_length(name), wt = n)
```

You can extract parts of a string using `str_sub()`.
As well as the string, `str_sub()` takes `start` and `end` arguments which give the (inclusive) characters to start and end at:

```{r}
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
```

You can use negative values to count back from the end of the string: -1 is the last character, -2 is the second to last character, etc.

```{r}
str_sub(x, -3, -1)
```

Note that `str_sub()` won't fail if the string is too short: it will just return as much as possible:

```{r}
str_sub("a", 1, 5)
```

We could use `str_sub()` with `mutate()` to find the first and last letter of each name:

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  mutate(
    first = str_sub(name, 1, 1),
    last = str_sub(name, -1, -1)
  )
```

Sometimes you'll get a column that's made up of individual fixed length strings that have been joined together:

```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~ sex_year_age,
  "M200115",
  "F201503",
)
```

You can extract the columns using `str_sub()`:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(
  sex = str_sub(sex_year_age, 1, 1),
  year = str_sub(sex_year_age, 2, 5),
  age = str_sub(sex_year_age, 6, 7),
)
```

Or use the `separate()` helper function:

```{r}
df %>% 
  separate(sex_year_age, c("sex", "year", "age"), c(1, 5))
```

Note that you give `separate()` three columns but only two positions --- that's because you're telling `separate()` where to break up the string.

TODO: draw diagram to emphasise that it's the space between the characters.

Later on, we'll come back two related problems: the components having vary length are a separated by a character

### Exercises

1.  Use `str_length()` and `str_sub()` to extract the middle letter from each baby name. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

## Long strings

Sometimes the reason you care about the length of a string is because you're trying to fit it into a label.
stringr provides two useful tools for cases where your string is too long:

-   `str_trunc(x, 20)` ensures that no string is longer than 20 characters, replacing any thing too long with `â€¦`.

-   `str_wrap(x, 20)` wraps a string introducing new lines so that each line is at most 20 characters (it doesn't hyphenate, however, so any word longer than 20 characters will make a longer time)

## String summaries

`str_c()` combines multiple character vectors into a single character vector; the output is the same length as the input.
An related function is `str_flatten()`: it takes a character vector and returns a single string:

```{r}
str_flatten(c("x", "y", "z"))
```

Just like `sum()` and `mean()` take a vector of numbers and return a single number, `str_flatten()` takes a character vector and returns a single string.
This makes `str_flatten()` a summary function for strings, so you'll often pair it with `summarise()`:

```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~ name, ~ fruit,
  "Carmen", "banana",
  "Carmen", "apple",
  "Marvin", "nectarine",
  "Terence", "cantaloupe",
  "Terence", "papaya",
  "Terence", "madarine"
)
df %>%
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(fruits = str_flatten(fruit, ", "))
```

## Detect matches

To determine if a character vector matches a pattern, use `str_detect()`.
It returns a logical vector the same length as the input:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```

This makes it a logical pairing with `filter()`:

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(str_detect(name, "x"))
```

Remember that when you use a logical vector in a numeric context, `FALSE` becomes 0 and `TRUE` becomes 1.
That makes `sum()` and `mean()` useful if you want to answer questions about matches across a larger vector:

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(prop_x = mean(str_detect(name, "x")))
```

(Note that this gives us the proportion of names that contain an x; if you wanted the proportion of babies given a name containing an x, you'd need to perform a weighted mean).

A variation on `str_detect()` is `str_count()`: rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string:

```{r}
str_count(x, "p")
```

It's natural to use `str_count()` with `mutate()`:

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(name, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(name, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```

### Exercises

1.  For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple `str_detect()` calls.

    a.  Find all words that start or end with `x`.
    b.  Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
    c.  Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?

2.  What word has the highest number of vowels?
    What word has the highest proportion of vowels?
    (Hint: what is the denominator?)

## Introduction to regular expressions

Before we can continue on we need to discuss the second argument to continue to `str_detect()` --- it's not a fixed string, but a pattern, called a regular expression.
A regular expression uses special characters

```{r}
str_detect(x, ".")
```

You can opt-out with by using `fixed`:

```{r}
str_detect(x, fixed("."))
```

Note that regular expressions are case sensitive by default:

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(str_detect(name, "X"))
babynames %>% filter(str_detect(name, fixed("X", ignore_case = TRUE)))
```

A common use of `str_detect()` is to select the elements that match a pattern.
This makes it a natural pairing with `filter()`.
The following regexp finds all names with repeated pairs of letters (you'll learn how that regexp works in the next chapter)

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  filter(n > 100) %>% 
  count(name, wt = n) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "(..).*\\1"))
```

Simple patterns we'll use:

-   `.` match any character

-   `[abcd]` match "a", "b", "c", or "d".

-   `+` means match one or more: `a+` means match one or more as in a row; `.+` means match one or more of anything; `[abcd]+` means match one of more of a/b/c/d in a row.

Can use `str_view_all()` see what a regular expression matches:

```{r}
str_view_all(x, "p+")
str_view_all(x, "a.")
```

## Replacing matches

`str_replace_all()` allow you to replace matches with new strings.
The simplest use is to replace a pattern with a fixed string:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

With `str_replace_all()` you can perform multiple replacements by supplying a named vector.
The name gives a regular expression to match, and the value gives the replacement.

```{r}
x <- c("1 house", "1 person has 2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
```

`str_remove_all()` is a short cut for `str_replace_all(x, pattern, "")` --- it removes matching patterns from a string.

Use in `mutate()`

#### Exercises

1.  Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.

2.  Implement a simple version of `str_to_lower()` using `str_replace_all()`.

3.  Switch the first and last letters in `words`.
    Which of those strings are still words?

## Extract full matches

To extract the actual text of a match, use `str_extract()`.
To show that off, we're going to need a more complicated example.
I'm going to use the [Harvard sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_sentences), which were designed to test VOIP systems, but are also useful for practicing regexps.
These are provided in `stringr::sentences`:

```{r}
length(sentences)
head(sentences)
```

Imagine we want to find all sentences that contain a colour.
We first create a vector of colour names, and then turn it into a single regular expression:

```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
```

Now we can select the sentences that contain a colour, and then extract the colour to figure out which one it is:

```{r}
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)
```

Note that `str_extract()` only extracts the first match.
We can see that most easily by first selecting all the sentences that have more than 1 match:

```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)

str_extract(more, colour_match)
```

This is a common pattern for stringr functions, because working with a single match allows you to use much simpler data structures.
To get all matches, use `str_extract_all()`.
It returns a list, so we'll come back to this later on.

### Exercises

1.  In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched "flickered", which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.

## Extract part of matches

If your data is in a tibble, it's often easier to use `tidyr::extract()`.
It works like `str_match()` but requires you to name the matches, which are then placed in new columns:

```{r}
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)", 
    remove = FALSE
  )
```

#### Exercises

1.  Find all words that come after a "number" like "one", "two", "three" etc.
    Pull out both the number and the word.

2.  Find all contractions.
    Separate out the pieces before and after the apostrophe.

## Strings -\> Columns

## Separate

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears.
Take `table3`:

```{r}
table3
```

The `rate` column contains both `cases` and `population` variables, and we need to split it into two variables.
`separate()` takes the name of the column to separate, and the names of the columns to separate into, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tidy-separate) and the code below.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

```{r tidy-separate, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Separating `rate` into `cases` and `population` to make `table3` tidy", fig.alt = "Two panels, one with a data frame with three columns (country, year, and rate) and the other with a data frame with four columns (country, year, cases, and population). Arrows show how the rate variable is separated into two variables: cases and population."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-17.png")
```

By default, `separate()` will split values wherever it sees a non-alphanumeric character (i.e. a character that isn't a number or letter).
For example, in the code above, `separate()` split the values of `rate` at the forward slash characters.
If you wish to use a specific character to separate a column, you can pass the character to the `sep` argument of `separate()`.
For example, we could rewrite the code above as:

```{r eval = FALSE}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```

`separate_rows()`

## Strings -\> Rows

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, eye_color) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(eye_color, ", ")) %>% 
  separate_rows(eye_color)
```

### Exercises

1.  Split up a string like `"apples, pears, and bananas"` into individual components.

2.  Why is it better to split up by `boundary("word")` than `" "`?

3.  What does splitting with an empty string (`""`) do?
    Experiment, and then read the documentation.

## Other languages {#other-languages}

Encoding, and why not to trust `Encoding`.
As a general rule, we recommend using UTF-8 everywhere, converting as a early as possible (i.e. by using the `encoding` argument to `readr::locale()`).

### Length and subsetting

This seems like a straightforward computation if you're only familiar with English, but things get complex quick when working with other languages.
Include some examples from <https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/>.

This is a problem even with European problem because Unicode provides two ways of representing characters with accents: many common characters have a special codepoint, but others can be built up from individual components.

```{r}
x <- c("\u00e1", "a\u0301")
x
str_length(x)
str_sub(x, 1, 1)
```

### Locales

Above I used `str_to_lower()` to change the text to lower case.
You can also use `str_to_upper()` or `str_to_title()`.
However, changing case is more complicated than it might at first appear because different languages have different rules for changing case.
You can pick which set of rules to use by specifying a locale:

```{r}
# Turkish has two i's: with and without a dot, and it
# has a different rule for capitalising them:
str_to_upper(c("i", "Ä±"))
str_to_upper(c("i", "Ä±"), locale = "tr")
```

The locale is specified as a ISO 639 language code, which is a two or three letter abbreviation.
If you don't already know the code for your language, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) has a good list.
If you leave the locale blank, it will use English.

Another important operation that's affected by the locale is sorting.
The base R `order()` and `sort()` functions sort strings using the current locale.
If you want robust behaviour across different computers, you may want to use `str_sort()` and `str_order()` which take an additional `locale` argument:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "eggplant", "banana")

str_sort(x, locale = "en")  # English

str_sort(x, locale = "haw") # Hawaiian
```

TODO: add connection to `arrange()`

### `coll()`

Beware using `fixed()` with non-English data.
It is problematic because there are often multiple ways of representing the same character.
For example, there are two ways to define "Ã¡": either as a single character or as an "a" plus an accent:

```{r}
a1 <- "\u00e1"
a2 <- "a\u0301"
c(a1, a2)
a1 == a2
```

They render identically, but because they're defined differently, `fixed()` doesn't find a match.
Instead, you can use `coll()`, defined next, to respect human character comparison rules:

```{r}
str_detect(a1, fixed(a2))
str_detect(a1, coll(a2))
```

-   

`coll()`: compare strings using standard **coll**ation rules.
This is useful for doing case insensitive matching.
Note that `coll()` takes a `locale` parameter that controls which rules are used for comparing characters.
Unfortunately different parts of the world use different rules!

```{r}
# That means you also need to be aware of the difference
# when doing case insensitive matches:
i <- c("I", "Ä°", "i", "Ä±")
i

str_subset(i, coll("i", ignore_case = TRUE))
str_subset(i, coll("i", ignore_case = TRUE, locale = "tr"))
```

Both `fixed()` and `regex()` have `ignore_case` arguments, but they do not allow you to pick the locale: they always use the default locale.
You can see what that is with the following code; more on stringi later.

```{r}
stringi::stri_locale_info()
```

The downside of `coll()` is speed; because the rules for recognising which characters are the same are complicated, `coll()` is relatively slow compared to `regex()` and `fixed()`.
